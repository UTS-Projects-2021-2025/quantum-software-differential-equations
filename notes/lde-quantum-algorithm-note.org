* Linear Differential Equations (LDE)

Recall that a differential equation that is written in terms of it's derivative. For example Schrodinger's equation is a differential equation,

\begin{align}
i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \ket{\Psi(t)} = \hat{H}\ket{\Psi(t)}
\end{align}

A linear differential equation (LDE) is an equation where each derivative

\begin{align}
c_{0}f(x) + c_{1}\frac{df(x)}{dx} + c_{2}\frac{df^{2}(x)}{dx^{2}}\cdots c_{k-1}\frac{df^{k-1}(x)}{dx^{k-1}} + c_{k} = 0
\end{align}

Solving LDE's is incredibly important in material science, physics and economics.
